# jokeAPI_project

This project uses three API endpoints from the offical joke api repo
https://github.com/15Dkatz/official_joke_api/tree/master

Endpoints: 

1. https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke
2. https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/types
3. https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/programming/random Where "programming" in the url can be one of the types from the prior API so it will be a path parameter.
